# FrshCart Ecommerce App
The project is an E-commerce web application built using React.js.
It provides a seamless shopping experience for users, with features
such as product browsing, product details, wish list management,
cart management, login, register, reset password, and a secure
checkout process.

### Key Features:

- Stylish Interface: With Bootstrap’s versatile grid system and components, I’ve designed a visually appealing and responsive interface that adapts to any screen size.
- React Library: The site’s dynamic features are driven by React’s efficient update and rendering system, ensuring a smooth user journey from homepage to checkout.
- Formik: User authentication is handled with precision. Formik streamlines the form-handling process, making sign-ups, log-ins, and password resets a breeze.
- Context API: State management is simplified with React’s Context API, providing a global state that’s accessible across all components without prop drilling.
- Route Academy API: Integration with the Route Academy E-commerce API means that product data, inventory management, and order processing are all in sync, providing users with up-to-date information.

### Behind the Scenes:

- Bootstrap: I chose Bootstrap for its extensive library of pre-styled components, which accelerated the development process and ensured consistency across the site.
- React.js: The choice of React.js was deliberate, allowing me to manage the state and lifecycle of each component effectively, resulting in a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- Formik: Implementing Formik for form management meant I could handle complex form validation and submission without the headache, enhancing the user experience.
- Context API: By utilizing the Context API for state management, I’ve ensured that the state flows naturally throughout the application, maintaining a clean and manageable codebase.

This project was an opportunity for me to learn and apply new technologies, enhancing both the website and my development skills.
